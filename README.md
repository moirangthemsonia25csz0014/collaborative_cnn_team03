# Collaborative CNN Team 03

This repository contains CNN model for image classification. It's a github collaboratory project between two Users.

**#User 1**  
Create the base model and train-test the datasets on: [Plant Village Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)
All important weights and results will be uploaded in respective folder for easy access by user 2

**#User 2**  
Create a fork for this repo and test on user1's model weights using User2 dataset: [New Plant Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset)
Then modify the model accordingly for better performance. And lastly upload the weights and results.

**#Final Step**
User2's weights will be further use by User1 to verify on user1 dataset
